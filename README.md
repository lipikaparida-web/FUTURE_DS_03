# FUTURE_DS_03 – College Event Feedback Analysis

## Internship Program
**Future Interns – Data Science & Analytics Internship**

---

## 📌 Task Description
This repository contains **Task 3** of the Data Science & Analytics Internship program.  
The task focuses on analyzing student feedback collected after college events to extract meaningful insights using data analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

The goal is to understand student satisfaction, identify common feedback patterns, and provide actionable recommendations that can help improve future campus events.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
The key objectives of this task are:
- Clean and prepare feedback data collected via a Google Forms–style dataset
- Analyze student satisfaction ratings on a 1–5 scale
- Apply NLP techniques to classify feedback sentiment (Positive / Neutral / Negative)
- Visualize insights using charts and graphs
- Suggest data-driven improvements for future event planning

---

## 📂 Dataset Information
- **File:** `student_feedback.csv`
- **Type:** Simulated Google Forms feedback dataset
- **Contents:**
  - Event name and event type
  - Hosting department
  - Student rating (1–5 scale)
  - Textual feedback comments

The dataset simulates real-world feedback collected after college events such as workshops, seminars, cultural programs, and tech fests.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python** – Core programming language
- **Google Colab** – Cloud-based notebook environment
- **pandas** – Data cleaning and manipulation
- **TextBlob** – NLP-based sentiment analysis
- **Matplotlib** – Data visualization

---

## 🔍 Analysis Performed

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Removed missing or inconsistent values
- Converted rating values into numeric format
- Ensured the dataset was ready for analysis

### 2️⃣ Rating Analysis
- Calculated average ratings across event types
- Identified top-performing events
- Analyzed satisfaction patterns to understand student preferences

### 3️⃣ Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
- Classified feedback comments into:
  - Positive
  - Neutral
  - Negative
- Visualized sentiment distribution using a pie chart
- Extracted common feedback themes using a word cloud

### 4️⃣ Data Visualization
- Bar chart showing average rating by event type
- Pie chart summarizing sentiment distribution
- Word cloud highlighting frequently used feedback terms

---

## 📊 Key Insights
- Workshops and interactive events received higher satisfaction ratings
- Passive event formats showed comparatively lower engagement
- Sentiment analysis revealed mostly positive feedback, with recurring concerns related to scheduling, session length, and logistics
- Interactivity and clear structure strongly influence student satisfaction

---

## ✅ Recommendations
Based on the analysis, the following improvements are suggested:
- Increase interactive and hands-on event formats
- Improve time management and scheduling
- Enhance venue and audio arrangements
- Collect structured feedback consistently after every event
- Use high-performing events as benchmarks for future planning
